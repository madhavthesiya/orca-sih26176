"""Fishing probability model.

Answers the question a fisher actually asks — *where am I likely to catch
something, when should I go, and how long should I stay* — rather than only
"is it safe".

The score is a transparent product of five documented factors:

  chlorophyll   plankton -> forage fish -> catch. The strongest single signal
                in INCOIS PFZ methodology.
  SST band      most Indian coastal target species concentrate in a
                temperature band; distance from that band reduces likelihood.
  front         a sharp SST change against the surrounding water marks a
                convergence line where bait accumulates.
  sea state     rough water both scatters shoals and stops small craft from
                working gear effectively.
  time of day   dawn and dusk feeding peaks are the best-established pattern
                in small-scale fisheries.

We are explicit that this is a LIKELIHOOD, never a promise. The same caveat is
repeated in every user-facing string.
